## Use
To play this mission, simply extract the entire folder named "OP_Kujari_Stabilisation_Part_2_(ANZAC_2023).tem_kujari" into your Arma 3 mpmissions folder.

## Setting
 Kujari Stabilisation Part 2 (Action Hope Prevail) is the second installation of a story-driven campaign for Arma 3 where players play as 2007 era ADF personnel in the small Sub-Saharan African country of Kujari. This mission focuses primarily on UXO clearance.

Kujari is a small African country in Sub-Saharan Africa that has recently been overrun and terrorised by the Kujari National Liberation Front (KNFA).

## Background
Kujari Statbilisation was designed to give a fresh persepective of ADF operations in the 2007 period to the FoddSquad. This was done through community modifications to give a somewhat realistic and period accurate representation of ADF equipment.

 The KNFA recently launched mortar attacks onto the capital city, Geydam-Tchoukou, using old ammunition resulting in large amounts of UXO along the main road leading to the primary hospital of the region. ADF personnel are tasked with route clearance of UXO from PB Platypus to the city.
